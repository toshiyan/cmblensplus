[Healpix] -- has dependcy on cfitsio
(Instead, you can use a newer version of Healpix)

1: go to ${public}/Healpix/

2: ./configure 

Then, you will be asked to answer many questions
Please choose the following answers: 
 - F90 compiler: ifort (this is recommended, but other compiler works as well)
