Use of the HEALPix/healpy software package should be explicitly acknowledged in all publications in the following form:

* an acknowledgment statement – "Some of the results in this paper have been derived using the healpy and HEALPix package"
* at the first use of the HEALPix acronym, a footnote placed in the main body of the paper referring to the HEALPix website – currently http://healpix.sourceforge.net
