	Code to create non-Gaussian simulations of the CMB
        --------------------------------------------------

Included in this distribution is:

makefile - you will need to edit this with the location of
your HEALPIX directory, f90 compiler etc

sky_ng_sim.f90 - code to simulate full-sky non-Gaussian maps
sky_ng_sim_bin.f90 - as above, but using disjoint bins in multipole
space with a different non-Gaussian being used in each bin.
sky_sub.f90 - module used by the above programs
sub_ngpdf_sho.f90 - module containing subroutines to draw
pixel values from non-Gaussian pdf based on the eigenstates
of a harmonic oscillator
sub_ngpdf_powergauss.f90 - module containing subroutines to
draw pixel values from Gaussian pdf raised to some power
(has a much greater skewness than SHO)

sky.par - example parameter file for sky_ng_sim
sky_bin.par - example parameter file for sky_ng_sim_bin


Integration in Healpix
----------------------
- in progress, sky_ng_sim and sky_ng_sin_bin will eventually be merged into a single code
- replacement of idum parameter with iseed, to be consistent with synfast.
- No pgplot, unless the preprocessing directive PGPLOT is given during compilation
examples: my_ng_sim.par   and   my_ng_sim_bin.par
