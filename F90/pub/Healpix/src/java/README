Installing Java
===============

Java Development Kit (JDK aka SDK): required to compile any Java code
---------------------------------
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html

Java based build tool: Ant
--------------------------

It is also available thru fink for MacOS


About Junit
===========
junit.jar is required for Java Healpix library installation.
It is shipped with Healpix and available in 
<HEALPIX>/src/java/lib/
Just make sure that this path (or a path to any other junit.jar)
is included in your CLASSPATH environment variable.
Alternatively you can use ant's "-lib" option:
  ant -lib lib/junit*.jar test

Please contact healpix-support AT lists.sourceforge.net for any questions on the
code or its installation.
