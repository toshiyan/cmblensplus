This file describes how to install each public code from the source. 
You can use install.sh file. 
You can also install codes automatically in other ways and copy the library files to lib/ directory for each package


Here, ${public} denotes the path to this directory.

[FFTW]

1: go to ${public}/FFTW/ 

2: untar the tar file (e.g. fftw-3.3.8.tar) and go inside further the directory

3: ./configure --prefix=${public}/FFTW/ --enable-openmp --enable-shared --enable-static; make; make install


[CFITSIO]

1: go to ${public}/cfitsio/cfitsio

2: ./configure

3: make

4: mv libcfitsio.a ../


[Healpix] -- has dependcy on cfitsio

1: download Healpix_3.31_2016Aug26.tar.gz and extract all files under ${public}/Healpix/, then go to ${public}/Healpix/

2: ./configure 

Then, you will be asked to answer many questions
Please choose the following answers: 
 - F90 compiler: ifort (this is recommended, but other compiler works as well)
 - openmp is no longer supported, so use qopenmp option
 - choose cfitsio directory to ../cfitsio/

3: make

4: make test (to check your compilation)

5: go to ${public}/Healpix/lib and rename libsharp_healpix_f.a to libsharp.a


Instead, you can use a newer version of Healpix, but then you need to install libsharp.


[Lenspix] -- has dependcy on Healpix and cfitsio

go to ${public}/lenspix/src and type "make; make install"


[Lapack95]

--- first install Lapack

1: go to ${public}/LAPACK95/ and download a file e.g. type "wget -d http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack.tgz"

2: type "gunzip -c lapack.tgz | tar xvf -" 

3: go to lapack-xxx/ and copy INSTALL/make.inc.ifort as make.inc and edit
  FFLAGS = -fPIC -O3 -fp-model strict -assume protect_parens -recursive
  FFLAGS_NOOPT = -fPIC -O0 -fp-model strict -assume protect_parens -recursive

4: type "make" and then "mv *.a ../lib/"


--- next install Lapack95

1: go to ${public}/LAPACK95 and download a file e.g. type "wget -d http://www.netlib.org/lapack95/lapack95.tgz"

2: type "gunzip -c lapack95.tgz | tar xvf -" 

3: go to LAPACK95/ and edit make.inc file as
  FC = ifort -fPIC
  FC1 = ifort -fPIC

4: go to SRC/ and type "make single_double_complex_dcomplex"

5: move files
  mv ${public}/LAPACK95/LAPACK95/lapack95.a .${public}/LAPACK95/lib/liblapack95.a
  mv ${public}/LAPACK95/LAPACK95/lapack95_modules .${public}/LAPACK95/mod
